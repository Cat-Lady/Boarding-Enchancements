# Boarding Enchancements

This plugin integrates boarding enchancements (doh!) into FOSS game "Endless Sky". It adds various human-space boarding related outfits, balanced around vanilla experience and fully integrated into game (purchase availability, usage by AI fleets, licenses required) - everything should perfectly fit into base game's feel. 



## Features
- 8 new types of gear for your (and enemy) crew to use during boarding - ranging from Dirt Belt's hunting rifles and small sidearms, to full fledged Navy's Advanced Tactical Battle Suit.

- 2 ship's outfits that greatly increase battle readiness of crew stationed aboard vessel's sporting them.

- Full and seamless integration into rest of the game. Stuff is available for purchase in sensible places (if you meet the criteria - for more powerful ones), AI ships use it - progressively integrating more numerous and powerful outfits as certain in-game war event unfolds - and overall, strong gear is in possesion of forces that you would expect them to do so (be sure to expect certain renegade warlords to be armed to teeth).

- For the first time in Endless Sky - quasi-random distribution of boarding outfits on AI controlled ships. Even when meeting "same" or similarly constructed fleet, you can never be sure if you will encounter only token defence or full-fledged boarding regiment (especially on warships) - or, anything in between. **Hint:** As an effect, "Outfit Scanner" becomes much more useful thing to have. Knowing what you expect might now be a difference between choosing vulnerable targets and diving head-on into suicidal boarding attempt.

- As indirect effect, boarding military targets or well-defended merchant fleets is now much more challenging... But also, much more rewarding, if you are prepared and act wisely.




### Installing

Unpack to your ES plugins folder. Be sure that you have single ``boarding-enhancements`` directory inside your plugin folder, containing ``data`` and ``images`` directories - it **won't** work if the directory structure will be anything like:
```(...)/plugins/Boarding-Enhancements/boarding-enhancements/(...)```
