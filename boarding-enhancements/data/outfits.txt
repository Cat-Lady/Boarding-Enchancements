	description "This is a standardized set used by Militia boarding complements, or guards onboard (wealthy) merchant's fleets. Typically, it contains of a flack vest (offering fair amount of protection from blaster and laser fire, impenetrable to blades and bullets), a laser rifle and stun grenade. The only thing giving better protection is the Navy's licensed ATBS (Advanced Tactical Battle Suit)."

	description "The Navy's Advanced Tactical Battle Suit (ATBS) is a full an complete ensemble - providing protection from head to toe, and nearly impenetrable to regular blaster or laser fire. The helmet's HUD paired with an Plasma Assault Rifle shows real-time targeting information and calculates origin of incoming projectiles. Grenades and a backup pistol complete this battle-proven set. (Un)fortunately, its production is tightly controlled, and those are only available to the Republic Navy's/Intelligence shock squads... Or, very rarely, worn by pirates, who somehow managed to overcome Navy's warships (and broken system's protection against unauthorized use)."

	description "Bolt Action Rifles are old projectile weapons, primarily used by farmers in the dirt belt to kill wildlife that is threatening their crops (or themselves). These rifles are very acurate, but hold limited ammunition and are painfully slow to reload. Despite this, when you try to board or are boarded, having one is still better than nothing."
